This is a snapshot of the 0.1 version of the game I am developing.
I created this project with the intent of learning Godot and improving my scripting skills.
This is the list of requirements I made for what I considered the most basic parts of a game. The end product will be significantly different, but I felt that it was important to provide clear milestones in the development process.

Menus
    start game scene
    game over scene
Player
    Move
        Play move animations
        environmental collisions
    Attack
        Play attack animations
        attack hit box
    Take damage
        hurt box
        hit flash
        death
Mob
    Move/attack/dmg Same as player
    pathfind to player
    spawn in random or target zones
    clear from memory after death

I have greatly enjoyed making this project and have already learned some valuable lessons on project management, logical organization, and of course, scripting.
Creating even a project as simple as this has been rewarding and has reminded me of why I got into tech in the first place.
There's something special about hitting that run button and seeing lines of code spring to life.
